### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I am a Systems Analyst at Retail Consult, a retail company based in Portugal, where I collaborate with a global customer base, using the Oracle Xstore product to develop innovative features and resolve bugs. Working in an agile environment with two-week sprints.

## Education
- Master's Degree in Network Engineering and Computer Science
- Thesis: Exploring Relational Learning with Python
  - Explored relational learning techniques to create connections between data
  - Leveraged machine learning models to extract new knowledge from data

## Recent Experience
I am enrolled in a course of Data Engineering by EDIT (https://weareedit.io/formacao/data-engineering/) where I am learning about: Fundamentals of Data Engineering, Data Pipeline Orchestration, Data Warehouse Construction and Real-Time Processing, in the end of the course there is an applied project where I believe the idea is to apply all of this concepts.

I have expanded my skills in Node.js through a dedicated course. Here are some of the technologies and frameworks I have worked with:
- Express.js
- REST API development
- Multer for file handling
- MongoDB and MySQL for data storage
- MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture
